# HW3
HW 3 PyBank and PyPoll!

Coded in Python using VS Code to conduct a financial analysis and "modernize" the vote-counting process for an election in a small town.

Code was modeled after Professor Booth's code (used as direction, not necessarily as answers), with some modifications.

Code was debugged with help of chat gpt.
